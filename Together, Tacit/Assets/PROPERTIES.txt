# !!READ ME!!
# Before running the Together, Tacit program with the Haptic Gloves,
# make sure to set the COM ports within this PROPERTIES file correctly.
# Otherwise, the program will be unable to connect to the gloves.
#
# To locate and change the COM ports prior to running the program...
#   1) Open up the Windows Device Manager.
#        - Press the Windows key to open the search bar.
#        - Search for "Device Manager" and open the first result.
#   2) Scroll down to the tab labeled "Ports (COM & LPT)" and expand it.
#   3) Plug in the first controller (either left or right).
#        - A new device should appear under the "Ports" tab.
#        - Keep track of the name of this new device (COM4, COM12, ect...)
#   4) Set the COM port of the controller within this file to the
#      name of the device in the Device Manager.
#        - It should match the listed name exactly (including case)
#        - ex. "left-controller-com-port=COM11"
#   5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the other controller (if using two).
#        - If one or both hands are using Oculus Quest controllers,
#        - the property field can be left blank.
#        - ex. "left-controller-com-port="
#   6) Save this file, then restart the program.
#
# Properties:

left-controller-com-port=COM11
right-controller-com-port=
